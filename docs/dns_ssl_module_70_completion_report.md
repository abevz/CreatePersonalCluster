# Step 15 - DNS/SSL Module Creation Completion Report

## Overview
Successfully completed Step 15 of the CPC modularization project by creating and integrating the DNS/SSL management module. This module provides comprehensive certificate management and DNS operations functionality for Kubernetes clusters.

## Implementation Summary

### Created Module: `modules/70_dns_ssl.sh`
- **Size**: 577 lines of code
- **Functions**: 7 main functions
- **Commands**: 5 user-facing commands
- **Purpose**: Certificate lifecycle management and DNS resolution testing

### Key Components

#### 1. Certificate Management
- **`regenerate-certificates`**: Regenerate Kubernetes certificates with DNS hostname support
  - Uses existing Ansible playbook `regenerate_certificates_with_dns.yml`
  - Interactive node selection (control plane, all nodes, specific node)
  - Safety confirmations and backup procedures
  - Post-regeneration verification

- **`verify-certificates`**: Comprehensive SSL certificate validation
  - Local certificate file inspection (when available)
  - Remote cluster connectivity verification
  - Certificate expiry checking via OpenSSL
  - Subject Alternative Names (SANs) display

- **`inspect-cert`**: Detailed certificate file analysis
  - Interactive certificate path selection
  - Detailed certificate information extraction
  - Expiry warnings for multiple timeframes (1 day, 1 week, 1 month)
  - Certificate validity status checking

#### 2. DNS Operations
- **`test-dns`**: DNS resolution testing within cluster
  - Custom domain testing with optional DNS server specification
  - Temporary pod creation for cluster-based testing
  - Internal and external DNS validation
  - Comprehensive troubleshooting tips

- **`check-cluster-dns`**: Comprehensive DNS system analysis
  - CoreDNS pod and service status checking
  - Configuration inspection and validation
  - Multi-level DNS resolution testing
  - Common networking issues detection

### Integration Points

#### Main Script Integration
- Added DNS/SSL command section to help text
- Integrated 5 commands with alias support in case statement:
  - `regenerate-certificates` / `regenerate-cert`
  - `test-dns` / `test-resolution`
  - `verify-certificates` / `verify-cert` / `check-cert`
  - `check-cluster-dns` / `test-cluster-dns`
  - `inspect-cert` / `show-cert`

#### Module Dependencies
- **Ansible Module**: Uses `ansible_run_playbook()` for certificate regeneration
- **Kubernetes Tools**: kubectl for cluster operations and DNS testing
- **OpenSSL**: Certificate inspection and validation
- **Standard Tools**: bash, date, grep, awk for various operations

### Architecture Design

#### Function Structure
```bash
cpc_dns_ssl()                    # Main command dispatcher
├── dns_ssl_regenerate_certificates()  # Certificate lifecycle management
├── dns_ssl_test_resolution()          # DNS resolution testing
├── dns_ssl_verify_certificates()      # Certificate validation
├── dns_ssl_check_cluster_dns()        # Comprehensive DNS checking
├── dns_ssl_inspect_certificate()      # Certificate file inspection
└── dns_ssl_show_help()               # Module help system
```

#### Safety Features
- Interactive confirmations for destructive operations
- Comprehensive error checking and validation
- Timeout protection for cluster operations
- Backup recommendations and procedures
- Clear warning messages for downtime operations

### Testing Results

#### Functionality Testing
- ✅ Module loading and function export

- Backup and recovery guidance

### 4. Architectural Consistency
- Consistent with established modular patterns
- Proper function export and integration
- Standardized help system and error messages
- Clean separation of concerns

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `modules/70_dns_ssl.sh` - Complete DNS/SSL module implementation

### Modified Files
- `cpc` - Added DNS/SSL commands to help and case statement (7 lines added)

### Supporting Infrastructure
